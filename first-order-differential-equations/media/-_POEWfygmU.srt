00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,379


2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:04,169
Welcome to this first video, and actually the first video

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:06,799
in the playlist on differential equations.

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,809
I know I touched on this before when we did harmonic

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,169
motion, and I think I might have touched

6
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:12,449
on it in other subjects.

7
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:16,399
But now, because of your request, we'll do a whole

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,179
playlist on this.

9
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:20,489
And that's a fairly useful thing, because differential

10
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:26,729
equations is something that shows up in a whole set of

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,660
different fields.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,490
I've been requested by someone who's starting an economics

13
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,049
PhD program to do this; I've been requested by some people

14
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,659
who are going into physics, some people who are going into

15
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:36,179
engineering.

16
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,299
So it's a widely applicable area of study.

17
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:43,349
So let's just get started, before I keep going off on

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,079
useless stuff.

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,129
So the differential equations.

20
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,370
So the first question is: what is a differential equation?

21
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:49,729
You know what an equation is.

22
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,739
What is a differential equation?

23
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,670
Well, a differential equation is an equation that involves

24
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,679
an unknown function and its derivatives.

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,589
So what do I mean by that?

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:10,290
Well, let's say that I said that y prime plus y is equal

27
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,180
to x plus 3.

28
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,010
Here, the unknown function is y.

29
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,430
We could have written it as y of x, or we could have written

30
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:25,100
this as dy dx, the derivative of y with respect to x plus

31
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:29,009
this unknown function y is equal to plus 3.

32
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,439
We also could have written f prime of x plus f of x is

33
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,170
equal to plus 3.

34
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,850
All of these would have been valid ways of writing this

35
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,079
exact same differential equation.

36
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,099
And what's interesting here, and how this is a departure

37
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:48,890
from what we've learned before about just regular equations

38
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,019
is that-- let me write down a regular equation just to

39
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,500
remind you what they look like.

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,049
So a regular equation, if we had one variable, would look

41
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,310
something like this.

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,480
I don't know, x squared plus the cosine of x is equal to

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,570
the square root of x.

44
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:04,969
I just made that up.

45
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:08,109
Here, the solution is a number, or sometimes it's a

46
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,770
set of numbers.

47
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,030
Sometimes there's more than one, right?

48
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,759
If you have a polynomial, you could have more than one

49
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,259
values of x that satisfy this equation.

50
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,870
Here, for a differential equation, the

51
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,289
solution is a function.

52
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:24,599
Our goal is to figure out what function of x, and here I

53
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,400
wrote f of x explicitly, but what function of x explicitly

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,980
satisfies this relationship or this equation.

55
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,679
So let me show you what I mean by that.

56
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,379
And I have my differential equations book from college,

57
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,310
so I'm going to use that as we go.

58
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,289
So let's say that-- I'm just writing now.

59
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,120
See, they have this as a differential equation.

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,710
And I'm not going to show you necessarily how to solve them

61
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,890
just yet, because we have to learn some tricks first. But I

62
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:56,649
think a good place to start is just so you understand what a

63
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,620
differential equation is, so you don't get confused with

64
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,460
the traditional equation.

65
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,900
So, they have this differential [? derivative. ?]

66
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,050
y prime prime.

67
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,280
So the second derivative of y with respect to x, plus 2

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,090
times the first derivative of y with respect to x, minus 3 y

69
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,909
is equal to 0.

70
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,990
And they give us the solutions here, and what they want us to

71
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,210
do is show that these are solutions.

72
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,020
And I think this is a good place to just at least

73
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,930
understand what a differential equation is, and what its

74
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,969
solution means.

75
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:34,000
So they say y1 of x is equal to e to the minus 3x.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,310
So they claim that this is a solution of this

77
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,039
differential equation.

78
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,169
So let me show to you that this is.

79
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:44,589
Well, if this is soon. y1, what's y-- well, let

80
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,569
me just write y1.

81
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,079
What's y1 prime?

82
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,010
What's the derivative of this?

83
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,689
Well, just do the chain rule.

84
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:55,180
The derivative of the whole function, with respect to this

85
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,420
part of it, is just e to the minus 3x.

86
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,349
And then you take the derivative of the inside.

87
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,079
So that's just the derivative of the outside, e

88
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,550
to the minus 3x.

89
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:08,160
And the derivative of the inside is minus 3.

90
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,020
And the second derivative of y1 is equal to-- we'll just

91
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,189
take the derivative of this, and that's just equal to plus

92
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,100
9-- minus 3 times minus 3-- e to the minus 3x.

93
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,060
Now, let's verify that if we substitute y1 and its

94
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,930
derivatives back into this differential equation, that it

95
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,519
holds true.

96
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,729
So y prime prime, that's this.

97
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:39,129
So we get nine e to the minus 3x, plus 2y prime.

98
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,110
Plus 2 times y prime.

99
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,620
Well, this is y prime.

100
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,810
So 2 times minus 3 e to the minus 3x plus-- oh sorry,

101
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,009
minus-- 3 times y.

102
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,430
Well, y is this.

103
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,439
So minus 3 times e to the minus 3x.

104
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,439
Well, what does that equal?

105
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:09,259
We get 9 e to the minus 3x, minus 6 e to the minus 3x,

106
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:11,670
minus 3 e to the minus 3x.

107
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,980
Well, what does that equal?

108
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,160
We have 9 of something minus 6 of

109
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,290
something minus 3 of something.

110
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,460
So that just equals 0.

111
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,549
It doesn't matter of 0 whatever.

112
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,139
So that equals 0.

113
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:26,779
So we verified that for this function, for y1 is equal to e

114
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:30,869
to the minus 3x, it satisfies this differential equation.

115
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,079
Now there's something interesting here, and you've

116
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,339
kind of touched on this with regular equations, is that

117
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,319
this might not be the only solution.

118
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,519
In fact we'll learn, in maybe a video or two, that often the

119
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,759
solution is not just a function.

120
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,209
It could be a class of functions where usually

121
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:49,899
they're all kind of the same function, but you have a

122
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:50,979
difference of constants.

123
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,200
But I'll show you that in a second.

124
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,849
But here, they actually show us that there's another

125
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,960
solution, that this will actually work with, we could

126
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,799
try the equation y2 of x is equal to, well, just

127
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,020
simple e to the x.

128
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:07,549
And we could verify that, right?

129
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,900
What's the first and second derivatives of e to the x?

130
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,469
Well, they're just e to the x.

131
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,270
So the second derivative of y2 is just e to the x plus 2

132
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:22,729
times the first derivative is what?

133
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,710
Well the first derivative of e to the x is still e to the x,

134
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:27,969
2 e to the x, minus 3 times a function.

135
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,320
Minus 3e to the x.

136
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,009
Well, 1 plus 2 minus 3, well that equals 0 again.

137
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:41,689
So this was also a solution to this differential equation.

138
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:44,509
Now before we go on, in the next one I'll show you some

139
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:45,920
fairly straightforward differential

140
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,650
equations to solve.

141
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,859
I think it's a good time now, now that you hopefully have a

142
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,569
grasp of what a differential equation is, and what its

143
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:55,370
solution is.

144
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,610
And its solution isn't a number, its solution is a

145
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,759
function, or a set of functions,

146
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,379
or a class of functions.

147
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,819
It's a good time to just go over a little bit of

148
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,099
terminology.

149
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,820
So there's two big classifications.

150
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:09,579
Well actually, there's a first big one, ordinary and partial

151
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:10,899
differential equations.

152
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:12,589
I think you might have already guessed what that means.

153
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,289
An ordinary differential equation is what I wrote down.

154
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,550
It's one variable with respect to another variable, or one

155
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,990
function with respect you to, say, x and its derivatives.

156
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,350
Partial differential equations we'll get into later.

157
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,189
That's more complicated.

158
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:27,699
That's when a function can be a function of

159
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:28,740
more than one variable.

160
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,120
And you can have the derivative with respect to x,

161
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,949
and y, and z.

162
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,569
We won't worry about that right now.

163
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,569
If your functions and their derivatives are a function of

164
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:38,629
only one variable, then we're dealing with an ordinary

165
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:39,490
differential equation.

166
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,730
That's what this playlist will deal with, ordinary

167
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:50,230
differential equations.

168
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,620
Now within ordinary differential equations,

169
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,709
there's two ways of classifying, and

170
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,279
they kind of overlap.

171
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,299
You have your order, so what is the order of my

172
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,180
differential equation?

173
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,819
And then you have this notion of whether it is linear or

174
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,099
non-linear.

175
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,640
And I think the best way to figure this out is just to

176
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,250
write down examples.

177
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,735
So let me write down one.

178
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:17,759
And I'm getting this from my college

179
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,060
differential equations book.

180
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,050
x squared times the second derivative of y with respect

181
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:33,188
to x, plus x times the first derivative of y with respect

182
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:40,719
to x, plus 2y is equal to sine of x.

183
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,250
So the first question here is: what is the order?

184
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,269
All the order is is the highest derivative that exists

185
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,600
in your equation.

186
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,360
The highest derivative of the function

187
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,149
under question, right?

188
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,649
The solution of this is going to be a y of x, that satisfies

189
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:56,879
this equation.

190
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,750
And the order is the highest derivative of that function.

191
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,080
Well, the highest derivative here is the second derivative.

192
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,500
So this has order 2.

193
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,860


194
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,960
Or as you could call this, a second order ordinary

195
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,360
differential equation.

196
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,779
Now the second thing we have to figure out: is this linear

197
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,639
or is this a non-linear differential equation?

198
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:23,600
So a differential equation is linear if all of the functions

199
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
and its derivatives are essentially, well for lack of

200
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,110
a better word, linear.

201
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,830
What do I mean by that?

202
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,509
I mean you don't have a y squared, or you don't have a

203
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,750
dy over dx squared, or you don't have a y times the

204
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,080
second derivative of y.

205
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,100
So this example I just wrote here, this is a second order

206
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,529
linear equation, because you have the second derivative,

207
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:49,579
the first derivative, and y, but they're not multiplied by

208
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,910
the function or the derivatives.

209
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:59,600
Now if this equation were-- if I rewrote it as x squared d,

210
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,259
the second derivative of y with respect to x squared, is

211
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:11,470
equal to sine of x, and let's say I were to square this.

212
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,660
Now, all of the sudden, I have a non-linear

213
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:14,689
differential equation.

214
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,860
This is non-linear.

215
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,029
This is linear.

216
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,189
Because I squared, I multiplied the second

217
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,410
derivative of y with respect-- I multiplied it times itself.

218
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,740
Another example of a non-linear equation is if I

219
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:35,230
wrote y times the second derivative of y with respect

220
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,389
to x is equal to sine of x.

221
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,799
This is also non-linear, because I multiplied the

222
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,139
function times its second derivative.

223
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:46,340
Notice here, I did multiply stuff times the second

224
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,009
derivative, but it was the independent variable x that I

225
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,200
multiplied.

226
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,690
But anyway, I've run out of time, and hopefully that gives

227
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,690
you a good at least survey of what a

228
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,270
differential equation is.

229
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:59,840
In the next video, we'll start actually solving them.
